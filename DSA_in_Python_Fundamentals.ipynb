        "### Understanding Generators\n",
        "\n",
        "So far, you’ve learned about the two primary ways of creating generators: by using generator functions (calling a function with yield like we do in normal python) and generator expressions (using `()` like in list comprehensions). You might even have an intuitive understanding of how generators work. Let’s take a moment to make that knowledge a little more explicit.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Generator functions look and act just like regular functions, but with one defining characteristic. Generator functions use the Python yield keyword instead of return. Recall the generator function you wrote earlier:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def infinite_sequence():\n",
        "    num = 0\n",
        "    while True:\n",
        "        yield num\n",
        "        num += 1\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This looks like a typical function definition, except for the Python yield statement and the code that follows it. yield indicates where a value is sent back to the caller, but unlike return, you don’t exit the function afterward.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, the state of the function is remembered. That way, when next() is called on a generator object (either explicitly or implicitly within a for loop), the previously yielded variable num is incremented, and then yielded again. Since generator functions look like other functions and act very similarly to them, you can assume that generator expressions are very similar to other comprehensions available in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Building Generators With Generator Expressions\n",
        "\n",
        "Like list comprehensions, generator expressions allow you to quickly create a generator object in just a few lines of code. They’re also useful in the same cases where list comprehensions are used, with an added benefit: you can create them without building and holding the entire object in memory before iteration. In other words, you’ll have no memory penalty when you use generator expressions. Take this example of squaring some numbers:\n",
