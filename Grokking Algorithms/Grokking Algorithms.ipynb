    "Sometimes you need to store a list of elements in memory. Suppose\n",
    "you’re writing an app to manage your todos. You’ll want to store the\n",
    "todos as a list in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Should you use an array, or a linked list? Let’s store the todos in an\n",
    "array first, because it’s easier to grasp. Using an array means all your\n",
    "tasks are stored contiguously (right next to each other) in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose you want to add a fourth task. But the next drawer is\n",
    "taken up by someone else’s stuff!\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s like going to a movie with your friends and finding a place to sit—\n",
    "but another friend joins you, and there’s no place for them. You have to\n",
    "move to a new spot where you all fit. In this case, you need to ask your\n",
    "computer for a different chunk of memory that can fit four tasks. Then\n",
    "you need to move all your tasks there.\n",
    "\n",
    "If another friend comes by, you’re out of room again—and you all have\n",
    "to move a second time! What a pain. Similarly, adding new items to\n",
    "an array can be a big pain. If you’re out of space and need to move to a\n",
    "new spot in memory every time, adding a new item will be really slow.\n",
    "One easy fix is to “hold seats”: even if you have only 3 items in your task\n",
    "list, you can ask the computer for 10 slots, just in case. Then you can\n",
    "add 10 items to your task list without having to move. This is a good\n",
    "workaround, but you should be aware of a couple of downsides:\n",
    "\n",
    "• You may not need the extra slots that you asked for, and then that\n",
    "memory will be wasted. You aren’t using it, but no one else can use\n",
    "it either.\n",
    "\n",
    "• You may add more than 10 items to your task list and have to\n",
    "move anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So it’s a good workaround, but it’s not a perfect solution. Linked lists\n",
    "solve this problem of adding items. \n",
    "\n",
    "With linked lists, your items can be anywhere in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each item stores the address of the next item in the list. A bunch of\n",
    "random memory addresses are linked together.\n",
    "\n",
    "With linked lists, you never have to move your items.\n",
    "\n",
    "If linked lists are so much better at inserts, what are arrays good for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Websites with top-10 lists use a scummy tactic to get more page views.\n",
    "Instead of showing you the list on one page, they put one item on each\n",
    "page and make you click Next to get to the next item in the list. For\n",
    "example, Top 10 Best TV Villains won’t show you the entire list on one\n",
    "page. Instead, you start at #10 (Newman), and you have to click Next on\n",
    "each page to reach #1 (Gustavo Fring). This technique gives the websites\n",
    "10 whole pages on which to show you ads, but it’s boring to click Next 9\n",
    "times to get to #1. It would be much better if the whole list was on one\n",
    "page and you could click each person’s name for more info.\n",
    "Linked lists have a similar problem. Suppose you want to read the last\n",
    "item in a linked list. You can’t just read it, because you don’t know what\n",
    "address it’s at. Instead, you have to go to item #1 to get the address for item #2. Then you have to go to item #2 to get the address for item #3.\n",
    "And so on, until you get to the last item. Linked lists are great if you’re\n",
    "going to read all the items one at a time: you can read one item, follow\n",
    "the address to the next item, and so on. But if you’re going to keep\n",
    "jumping around, linked lists are terrible.\n",
    "Arrays are different. You know the address for every item in your array.\n",
    "For example, suppose your array contains five items, and you know it\n",
    "starts at address 00. What is the address of item #5?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple math tells you: it’s 04. Arrays are great if you want to read\n",
    "random elements, because you can look up any element in your array\n",
    "instantly. With a linked list, the elements aren’t next to each other,\n",
    "so you can’t instantly calculate the position of the fifth element in\n",
    "memory—you have to go to the first element to get the address to the\n",
    "second element, then go to the second element to get the address of\n",
    "the third element, and so on until you get to the fifth element.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: In this case, you’re adding expenses to the list every day\n",
    "and reading all the expenses once a month. Arrays have fast reads\n",
    "and slow inserts. Linked lists have slow reads and fast inserts.\n",
    "Because you’ll be inserting more often than reading, it makes sense\n",

    "are two different types of access: random access and sequential access.\n",
    "Sequential access means reading the elements one by one, starting\n",
    "at the first element. Linked lists can only do sequential access. If you\n",
    "want to read the 10th element of a linked list, you have to read the first\n",
