    "### What is Python Multiprocessing?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let’s talk about parallel processing. This is a way to simultaneously break up and run program tasks on multiple microprocessors. In effect, this is an effort to reduce processing time and is something we can achieve with a computer with two or more processors or using a computer network. We also call this parallel computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, now coming to Python Multiprocessing, this is a way to improve performance by creating parallel code. CPU manufacturers make this possible by adding more cores to their processors. In a multiprocessing system, applications break into smaller routines to run independently. Take a look at a single processor system. Given several processes at once, it struggles to interrupt and switch between tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Multiprocessing` in Python is a package we can use with Python to spawn processes using an API that is much like the threading module. With support for both local and remote concurrency, it lets the programmer make efficient use of multiple processors on a given machine. Before we can begin explaining it to you, let’s take an example of Pool- an object, a way to parallelize executing a function across input values and distributing input data across processes. This is data parallelism (Make a module out of this and run it)-"
