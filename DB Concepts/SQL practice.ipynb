FROM and JOIN\n\nThe FROM clause, and subsequent JOINs are first executed to determine the total working set of data that is being queried. This includes subqueries in this clause, and can cause temporary tables to be created under the hood containing all the columns and rows of the tables being joined.\n\n2. WHERE\n\nOnce we have the total working set of data, the first-pass WHERE constraints are applied to the individual rows, and rows that do not satisfy the constraint are discarded. Each of the constraints can only access columns directly from the tables requested in the FROM clause. __Aliases in the SELECT part of the query are not accessible in most databases since they may include expressions dependent on parts of the query that have not yet executed.__\n\n3. GROUP BY\n\nThe remaining rows after the WHERE constraints are applied are then grouped based on common values in the column specified in the GROUP BY clause. __As a result of the grouping, there will only be as many rows as there are unique values in that column__. Implicitly, this means that you should only need to use this when you have aggregate functions in your query.\n\n4. HAVING\n\nIf the query has a GROUP BY clause, then the constraints in the HAVING clause are then applied to the grouped rows, discard the grouped rows that don't satisfy the constraint. __Like the WHERE clause, aliases are also not accessible from this step in most databases__.\n\n5. SELECT\n\nAny expressions in the SELECT part of the query are finally computed.\n\n6. DISTINCT\n\nOf the remaining rows, rows with duplicate values in the column marked as DISTINCT will be discarded.\n\n7. ORDER BY\n\nIf an order is specified by the ORDER BY clause, the rows are then sorted by the specified data in either ascending or descending order. Since all the expressions in the SELECT part of the query have been computed, you can reference aliases in this clause.\n\n\n8. LIMIT / OFFSET\n\nFinally, the rows that fall outside the range specified by the LIMIT and OFFSET are discarded, leaving the final set of rows to be returned from the query.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Difference bw DISTINCT and GROUP BY\n\n> https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/mysql-when-group-by-is-faster-than-distinct/272420\n\nIn some cases GROUP BY might be faster than DISTICT\n\n- When you run DISTINCT MySQL has to looks across all selected columns whereas GROUP BY will only do it for whatever columns you explicitly assign to GROUP BY so there is less work to do (my query was selecting about 15 columns)\n\nthis is true as far as it goes… however, if you have GROUP BY with only a few of your 15 columns, then technically you are running an invalid query in mysql (yes, mysql will run these invalid queries), and the results are indeterminate\n\n",

You will usually do this when your data is split up into multiple sections like an excel spreadsheet of a year’s sales split by month.\n\n![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fa5adad37-92c6-4924-b52c-2ab340ae351b%2FScreen_Shot_2021-03-15_at_12.23.40_PM.png?table=block&id=199c2a41-408a-4898-a329-c7810d5d9a39&spaceId=691f8197-dec0-4338-b1a8-a47162b151ba&width=1390&userId=bdc14b6b-7340-420b-85e2-540dbef29bc8&cache=v2)\n\n#### Joins\n\nJoins combine two tables horizontally. For a join, like a Union you have to have at least two tables, what we call our Left Table and our Right Table. You (mostly) have to have at least one matching column between the two tables, and you will match rows from these columns. The most common way to visualize the types of Joins are through Venn Diagrams.\n\n![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fba7b4d86-db23-4142-b860-2e23fce3bae4%2FScreen_Shot_2021-03-15_at_12.36.03_PM.png?table=block&id=31a987e2-12d3-4d95-bdbc-a37449be2b29&spaceId=691f8197-dec0-4338-b1a8-a47162b151ba&width=2000&userId=bdc14b6b-7340-420b-85e2-540dbef29bc8&cache=v2)\n\n![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fe94f8697-5537-4458-9992-4ea02defbea0%2FScreen_Shot_2021-03-15_at_12.36.37_PM.png?table=block&id=91c32502-734f-4ef3-90b6-d9725da9cd3b&spaceId=691f8197-dec0-4338-b1a8-a47162b151ba&width=960&userId=bdc14b6b-7340-420b-85e2-540dbef29bc8&cache=v2)\n\n__Inner Join__\n\nWe’re now going to do something called an Inner Join on the [ID] column which will only output exact matches from the [ID] column in our output.\n\n![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F1d7856a8-7fc5-4673-a7a6-522d5fd52a9c%2FScreen_Shot_2021-03-15_at_12.37.59_PM.png?table=block&id=b5c56e80-bb05-4dc5-955b-073c3d231bfc&spaceId=691f8197-dec0-4338-b1a8-a47162b151ba&width=1370&userId=bdc14b6b-7340-420b-85e2-540dbef29bc8&cache=v2)\n\n__Left Join__\n\nA Left Join keeps all of the data from your Left table and whatever matches from the Right table.\n\n![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fa4b067dc-dd79-4456-8cae-2f81a8ac4201%2FScreen_Shot_2021-03-15_at_12.39.07_PM.png?table=block&id=f0f911be-573d-415e-b829-873cd6c300c1&spaceId=691f8197-dec0-4338-b1a8-a47162b151ba&width=1350&userId=bdc14b6b-7340-420b-85e2-540dbef29bc8&cache=v2)\n\n__Right Join__\n\nA Right Join does the exact opposite and keeps everything from your Right table while only bringing in the matches from the Left table.\n\n![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F1235ef85-ef65-4e03-ba26-6661b39bad62%2FScreen_Shot_2021-03-15_at_12.39.43_PM.png?table=block&id=fd1880dd-7d29-477b-b654-7e22a9b9873c&spaceId=691f8197-dec0-4338-b1a8-a47162b151ba&width=1360&userId=bdc14b6b-7340-420b-85e2-540dbef29bc8&cache=v2)\n\n__Full Join__\n\nA Full Join brings in everything from both tables and matches whatever will match from the columns you specify.\n\n![](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fe42b3cca-c8df-48fb-9b63-211c498be6a9%2FScreen_Shot_2021-03-15_at_12.40.52_PM.png?table=block&id=02ceefe0-20a9-48f7-831d-88698f314d43&spaceId=691f8197-dec0-4338-b1a8-a47162b151ba&width=1360&userId=bdc14b6b-7340-420b-85e2-540dbef29bc8&cache=v2)\n\n__Cross Join__\n\nThe CROSS JOIN is used to generate a paired combination of each row of the first table with each row of the second table. This join type is also known as cartesian join.\n\nSuppose that we are sitting in a coffee shop and we decide to order breakfast. Shortly, we will look at the menu and we will start thinking of which meal and drink combination could be more tastier. Our brain will receive this signal and begin to generate all meal and drink combinations.\n\nThe following image illustrates all menu combinations that can be generated by our brain. The SQL CROSS JOIN works similarly to this mechanism, as it creates all paired combinations of the rows of the tables that will be joined.\n\n![](https://www.sqlshack.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sql-cross-join-working-mechanism.png)\n\nThe SQL queries which contain the CROSS JOIN keyword can be very costly as it will need nested loops. We try to say that these queries have a high potential to consume more resources and can cause performance issues.\n\nBriefly, when we decide to use the CROSS JOIN in any query, we should consider the number of the tables that will be joined. Such as, when we CROSS JOIN two tables and if the first one contains 1000 rows and the second one contains 1000 rows, the row count of the resultset will be 1.000.000 rows.",
